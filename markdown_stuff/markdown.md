"**Task:**<br/> Draw a line segment down the center of each silobag. Figure 1 provides an example. On the left, two typical silobags (long, narrow white strips) appear in a satellite image. On the right, line segments (shown in green) are drawn through the center of each silobag. <br/> ![fig 1](https://github.com/jschatz50/misc/blob/master/markdown_stuff/_Fig1.png) <br/> Figure 1. Annotation example, with silobags on left, and desired annotations on right (green lines). <br/> <br/> **Background**: <br/> Silobags are white plastic covers generally 60m (180 ft) long and 3-6m (9-18ft) wide (Figure 2). They are used by farmers to store harvested crops. <br/> ![fig 2](https://github.com/jschatz50/misc/blob/master/markdown_stuff/_Fig2.png) <br/> Figure 2. Closer view of silobags. <br/><br/> Silobags generally do not appear near cities or towns. In rural areas, buildings can often resemble silobags (e.g., farmhouses, sheds, or poultry farms). However, compared to silobags, buildings are often wider, shorter, brighter white, and may have driveways and roads leading to them (Figure 3, left). Groups that exhibit a geometrically regular layout are usually buildings, although silobags do sometimes occur in a straight line (Figure 3, right). <br/> ![fig 3](https://github.com/jschatz50/misc/blob/master/markdown_stuff/_Fig3.png) <br/> Figure 3. (left) Potential false positives (farm sheds) circled in red. (right) Potential false negatives (line of silobags) circled in green. <br/> <br/> <br/> **Examples of desired annotations** (original on left; labeled on right): <br/> ![true positive example](https://github.com/jschatz50/misc/blob/master/markdown_stuff/_Fig4.png) <br/> ![true positive example](https://github.com/jschatz50/misc/blob/master/markdown_stuff/_Fig5.png) <br/> ![true positive example](https://github.com/jschatz50/misc/blob/master/markdown_stuff/_Fig6.png) <br/> ![true positive example](https://github.com/jschatz50/misc/blob/master/markdown_stuff/_Fig7.png) <br/><br/> **Potential confusers** <br/> (Mostly linear buildings with white roofs -- circled in red) <br/> ![false positive example](https://github.com/jschatz50/misc/blob/master/markdown_stuff/_Fig8.png) <br/> ![false positive example](https://github.com/jschatz50/misc/blob/master/markdown_stuff/_Fig9.png)"
